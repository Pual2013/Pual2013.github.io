Hello! I am a final year Ph.D student in Dalian University of Technology, supervised by Haojie Li. Before that, I got M.S. in Dalian University of Technology, supervised by Zhihui Wang. 

My research interests include Computer Vision, Multimedia Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. I have a lot of research work on fine-grained image classification, fine-grained image retrieval and other vision problems. Recently, I have been working on vision/vision-language foundation models, especially the models based on the prompt tuning of pre-trained models.
