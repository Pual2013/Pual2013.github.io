# Biography

Hello! I received the Ph.D. degree from Dalian University of Technology, supervised by Haojie Li. Before that, I got the B.E. and M.S. degrees from the School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Multimedia Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. I have a lot of research work on fine-grained image classification, fine-grained image retrieval and other vision problems. Recently, I have been working on vision/vision-language foundation models, especially the models based on the prompt tuning of pre-trained models.
