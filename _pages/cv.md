Education
======
* Ph.D in	Dalian University of Technology, 2020.09-2023.12
* M.S. in Dalian University of Technology, 2017.09-2020.06

Industrial Experience
======
__<font size=5>Huawei Cloud • CV Research Intern • Advisor：Prof. Qi Tian, 2022.02-2024.01</font>__

* __Image Retrieval with Prompt Tuning:__

  We propose a novel Prompting Vision-Language Evaluator (PLEor) framework based on the recently introduced contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model, for open-set fine-grained retrieval. 

  We develop Fine-grained Retrieval Prompt Tuning (FRPT), which steers frozen pre-trained models to perform the fine-grained retrieval tasks from the perspectives of sample prompting and feature adaptation. 
* __Visual Tuning Survey:__

  Responsible for organizing and summarizing the Visual Prompt Tuning section in the survey on visual fine-tuning. The visual prompts are classified into three categories: visual-driven prompts, language-driven prompts, and visual-language integrated prompts
